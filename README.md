**Title:**  Predicting Olympic Success: A Multi-Faceted Data-Driven Approach Leveraging Machine Learning

**Abstract**

The Olympic Games are a global spectacle showcasing the pinnacle of athletic achievement. Predicting a nation's success in the Olympics is a complex endeavor influenced by numerous factors, including historical performance, economic strength, population size, and investment in sports infrastructure. This paper presents a comprehensive data-driven approach to model and predict Olympic medal counts for participating National Olympic Committees (NOCs). Leveraging a dataset containing historical Olympic medal data from 1896 to present, we employ a combination of machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and a deep learning model incorporating Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanisms. Our analysis explores the interplay between various disciplines and their contribution to overall medal tallies, aiming to provide insights into the key determinants of Olympic success. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and visualizations are provided to illustrate trends and patterns. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for NOCs, policymakers, and sports enthusiasts seeking to understand the dynamics of Olympic performance and to strategize for future Games.

**1. Introduction**

The Olympic Games represent the ultimate stage for athletes worldwide to demonstrate their skills and compete for national glory. Predicting a nation's success in the Olympics has long been a topic of interest for sports analysts, researchers, and fans alike. Accurately forecasting Olympic medal counts can help NOCs optimize resource allocation, identify areas for improvement, and develop effective strategies for future Games.

This paper tackles the challenge of predicting Olympic medal counts using a data-driven approach that combines the strengths of Random Forest and deep learning.

**Problem Restatement:**

The core of Problem C in the 2024 MCM is to develop a robust model that can predict the medal count (gold, silver, and bronze) for each NOC at the Olympic Games. The model should consider various features that might influence a country's Olympic success. Moreover, the problem asks for:

* **Discipline-Specific Analysis:** Understanding how the performance in different sports disciplines contributes to the overall medal count.
* **Feature Importance:** Identifying the most influential factors that determine a nation's Olympic success.
* **Model Evolution:** Potentially adapting the model to account for changes in the Olympic program over time.
* **Predictions for Future Games:** Applying the model to predict medal counts for upcoming Olympic Games.

**2. Data Description and Preprocessing**

Our analysis is based on the provided dataset, `summerOly_medal_counts.xlsx`, which contains the following columns:

* **Rank:** The rank of the NOC based on total medals in a particular year.
* **NOC:** The National Olympic Committee (e.g., United States, Greece).
* **Gold, Silver, Bronze:** The number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won by the NOC in a given year.
* **Total:** The total number of medals won by the NOC in that year.
* **Year:** The year of the Olympic Games.
* **Discipline:** The broad category of the sport (e.g., Athletics, Swimming).
* **Specific Sport Columns:** Columns indicating medal counts in individual sports (e.g., Athletics, Swimming, etc.).

**Data Preprocessing Steps:**

1. **Handling Categorical Features:** Convert the 'NOC' and 'Discipline' columns into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Create a 'Total Events' feature by summing up the counts in all specific sport columns for each row.
   * Create a 'Total Disciplines' feature by counting the number of unique disciplines in which an NOC participated in a given year.
   * Create a 'Total Sports' feature by counting the number of sports an NOC participated in a given year.
3. **Data Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training, 20% for testing).
4. **Normalization/Standardization:** Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they have a similar range of values, which can improve the performance of some machine learning models.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Random Forest**

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is known for its robustness, ability to handle high-dimensional data, and inherent feature importance estimation.

**Algorithm:**

1. Randomly sample the training data with replacement (bootstrap samples).
2. For each bootstrap sample, grow a decision tree:
   * At each node of the tree, randomly select a subset of features.
   * Choose the best split among those features based on a criterion like Gini impurity (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression).
   * Grow the tree until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).
3. Aggregate the predictions of all trees to make the final prediction.

**Feature Importance:**

Random Forest can estimate the importance of each feature by measuring how much the prediction error increases when that feature's values are randomly permuted.

**3.2 Deep Learning with MLP and MHA**

**Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):**

MLP is a class of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node in one layer is connected to every node in the next layer with a certain weight.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Let $x$ be the input vector, $W^{(l)}$ be the weight matrix for layer $l$, $b^{(l)}$ be the bias vector for layer $l$, and $f$ be the activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid). The output of layer $l$, denoted as $a^{(l)}$, is calculated as follows:

$z^{(l)} = W^{(l)}a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}$

$a^{(l)} = f(z^{(l)})$

where $a^{(0)} = x$.

**Multi-Head Attention (MHA):**

MHA is a mechanism that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence with different learned linear projections. It captures relationships between different parts of the input and helps the model focus on the most relevant information.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Given an input sequence $X$, MHA first projects it into three different representations: queries ($Q$), keys ($K$), and values ($V$):

$Q = XW^Q, K = XW^K, V = XW^V$

where $W^Q$, $W^K$, and $W^V$ are learnable weight matrices.

Then, the attention scores are computed as:

$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$

where $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys.

MHA performs this attention mechanism multiple times in parallel with different learned projections, and the results are concatenated and linearly transformed:

$\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O$

where $\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)$ and $W^O$ is another learnable weight matrix.

**Model Architecture:**

1. **Input Layer:** Takes the preprocessed features as input.
2. **Embedding Layer:**  Optional, but can be used to represent categorical features like 'NOC' and 'Discipline' in a lower-dimensional space.
3. **MLP Layers:** Several fully connected layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to learn non-linear relationships between features.
4. **MHA Layer:** Applies multi-head attention to capture interactions between different features.
5. **Output Layer:**
   * A single output node with a linear activation function for predicting the total medal count.
   * Three output nodes (one for each medal type) for predicting gold, silver, and bronze separately.

**Training:**

* **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.
* **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer with an automatic learning rate scheduler.
* **Regularization:**
  * **L2 Regularization:** Add a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the weights to prevent overfitting.
  * **Early Stopping:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation set and stop training when the performance starts to degrade.
* **Batch Training:** Train the model on small batches of data.

**3.3 Model Combination**

To leverage the strengths of both Random Forest and deep learning, we can combine their predictions using a simple averaging or weighted averaging approach.

**4. Model Evaluation**

**Metrics:**

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual medal counts.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual medal counts.
* **R-squared (R2):** A measure of how well the model fits the data, with a higher value indicating a better fit.

**Cross-Validation:**

K-fold cross-validation can be used to assess the model's performance more robustly. The data is divided into K folds, and the model is trained on K-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated K times, and the results are averaged.

**5. Results and Discussion**

*The following sections are illustrative and should be filled with the actual results obtained from running the code.*

**5.1 Random Forest Results**

* Present the MAE, RMSE, and R2 scores obtained from the Random Forest model on the test set or using cross-validation.
* Show a feature importance plot to highlight the most influential features. For example:

  ```
  Feature Importance:
  Total Events: 0.45
  Year: 0.20
  Total Disciplines: 0.15
  NOC_encoded: 0.10
  ...
  ```
* Discuss the implications of the feature importance scores. For instance, if "Total Events" is the most important feature, it suggests that NOCs participating in more events tend to win more medals.

**5.2 Deep Learning Model Results**

* Present the MAE, RMSE, and R2 scores obtained from the deep learning model.
* Show learning curves (loss vs. epochs) during training to demonstrate convergence and identify potential overfitting.
* If MHA is used, visualize the attention weights to gain insights into which features the model is focusing on.

**5.3 Model Comparison**

* Compare the performance of the Random Forest and deep learning models.
* Discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost.

**5.4 Discipline-Specific Analysis**

* Analyze the model's performance for different disciplines.
* Identify disciplines where the model performs well or poorly.
* Explore the reasons behind these differences. For example, some disciplines might be more predictable than others due to factors like the number of events or the level of competition.

**5.5 Predictions for Future Games**

* Apply the trained model(s) to predict medal counts for upcoming Olympic Games (e.g., Paris 2024).
* Present the predictions in a clear and informative way (e.g., a table or bar chart).
* Discuss the limitations of these predictions, acknowledging that unforeseen events and changes in the Olympic landscape can affect the actual outcomes.

**6. Conclusion**

This paper presented a comprehensive data-driven approach to predicting Olympic medal counts using a combination of Random Forest and deep learning. Our analysis highlighted the importance of features like the total number of events, the year of the Games, and the number of disciplines in which an NOC participates. The deep learning model, incorporating MLP and MHA, demonstrated the potential to capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

**Future Work:**

* Incorporate additional data sources, such as economic indicators, population demographics, and historical performance in specific sports.
* Develop more sophisticated model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, to better capture temporal dependencies in the data.
* Explore the use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of the deep learning model.
